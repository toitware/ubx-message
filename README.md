# UBX Message

Support for UBX messages from the UBX data protocol used by ublox GNSS receivers
in the Max-M* series.


## History
This library is a parser of messages from these recievers. The protocol was
developed and improved over time on earlier devices, but the parser was first
written for Toit for M8 devices.  Support for 6M devices/features has been added
later.
